# CGFdegree Assignment 2: Python ✨
## Question❓
### Due date: 02/06/2024
### Create a console app that interacts with an API of your choice, gets some data out of it, and does a meaningful transformation. You can pick one of the suggested APIs which are free and beginner-friendly, this will not impact creativity points. Make sure your API is free to use and do not share your private access key. 
Requirements:
- ⭐ Use boolean and if/else statements
- ⭐ Use data structures i.e. lists, dictionaries, tuples
- ⭐ Use for/while loops
- ⭐ Use functions with returns
- ⭐ Use string slicing
- ⭐ Use two built-in functions
- ⭐ Use any free API to get information as json
- ⭐ Add comments on how to set up necessary API keys and how using the API
- ⭐ Import an additional module
- ⭐ Write final results to a file
  
Assignment description:
> Create a program that retrieves multiple recipes based on user-provided pantry ingredients and saves only the names and quantities of missing ingredients to a file in a neat and readable format. The program asks the user for their name, the number of recipes they want to generate, and the ingredients they have available. It then fetches the recipes from the Spoonacular API and displays the recipe titles, missed ingredients (to buy), used ingredients (from the user's pantry) in a user-friendly format with delays for readability. The program writes the missing ingredients to a file named "shopping_list.txt" and includes pleasant messages to guide users through the process, as well as an optional wine pairing feature at the end 👾

Requirements met:
- [x] Used boolean and if/else values for wine pairing feature at end of programme
- [x] Used dictionaries to store simplified recipe information generated from Spoonacular API
- [x] Used for loops to store information from generated recipes, save to text file etc.
- [x] Used functions with returns to extract relevant information and print it in user-friendly format
- [x] Used string slicing and formatting to generalise user inputs for functionality
- [x] Used built-in Python functions such as int(), input(), format() etc.
- [x] Used the Spoonacular API to retrieve information in json format
- [x] Added comments to explain how to use API and set-up any necessary keys
- [x] Imported pprint and time modules for increased user readability
- [x] Exported outputs to blank text file in the form of a user shopping list
